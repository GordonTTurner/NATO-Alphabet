# NATO-Alphabet
If you ever wanted to learn the NATO Alphabet, what better way is there to learn it than by using the shell command line to test out any word and see how it translates into the alphabet!
To run this program in the command line, run ```python3 natoalphabet.py text_to_convert```.<br /><br />
Example: typing ```python3 natoalphabet.py Tacos``` in the command line lists out how tacos converts to the NATO alphabet. In this example, the output would be <br /><br />
t - tango<br />
a - alpha<br />
c - charlie<br />
o - oscar<br />
s - sierra
