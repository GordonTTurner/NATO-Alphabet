# NATO-Alphabet
If you ever wanted to learn the NATO Alphabet, what better way is there to learn it than by using the shell command line to test out any word and see how it translates into the alphabet!
To run this program in the command line, run <br /><br />```$ python3 natoalphabet.py text_to_convert```.<br /><br />
Example: typing ```python3 natoalphabet.py Tacos``` in the command line lists out how tacos converts to the NATO alphabet. In this example, the output would be <br /><br />
t - tango<br />
a - alpha<br />
c - charlie<br />
o - oscar<br />
s - sierra<br /><br />

If you want to run multiple words into the command, make sure to add quotations around the argument (single or double quotes work fine). For example, running ```python3 natoalphabet.py Tacos Are Fun``` produces the same output as above, but if you were to run ```python3 natoalphabet.py "Tacos Are Fun"```... <br /><br />

t - tango<br />
a - alpha<br />
c - charlie<br />
o - oscar<br />
s - sierra<br />
<br />
a - alpha<br />
r - romeo<br />
e - echo<br />
<br />
f - foxtrot<br />
u - uniform<br />
n - november
